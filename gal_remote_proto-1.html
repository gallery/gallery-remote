<p>This document describes the <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/">gallery</a> remote application protocol, which is layered over HTTP, as of version 1.3.1 of gallery.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Gallery remote queries and sends information from a gallery installation through a protcol based on HTTP and form-data.  The protocol leverages the same user authentication (and session cookies) as the web/HTML interface to the site.  It is implemented in one PHP source file, <samp><a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/gallery/gallery/gallery_remote.php?rev=1.6&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">gallery_remote.php</a></samp>.</p>

<p>Every query from client to server corresponds to one action.  Multiple actions require multiple HTTP requests.</p>

<p>The protocol is stateful; the client must acquire the gallery session cookie by performing a login request before any other requests will succeed.</p>

<p>Permissions for actions performed by gallery_remote.php are controlled in the same way they are controlled for regular web/HTML users.  <samp>init.php</samp> is called at the top of each request.</p>

<hr>
<a name="requests" />
<h2>Requests</h2>

<p>Each request is expressed through an HTTP POST -- parameters are expressed as HTTP form data (control-name/current value) pairs (we'll call them "key" and "value").</p>

<p>Each request specifies a command (the "<samp>cmd</samp>" key).  Depending on which command is specified, other parameters are required in the form-data set.</p>

<p>Each request also specifies a protocol version (the "<samp>protocal_version</samp>" [sic] key).  If the protocol version specified by the client does not match exactly <samp>$gallery->remote_protocol_version</samp>, the request is declined.  The current protocol version is "1" (it has never been changed).</p>

<p>Each command is described below.  After a brief description of the command, template form data appears and the result format (if any) is described.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Notes</h2>
The results sections below assume a HTTP <samp>200 OK</samp> status code was returned, although a <samp>4xx</samp> or <samp>5xx</samp> result is possible.  Additionally, if the protocol version is not correct, regardless of the command, an English textual error message is returned, with no other results.</p>

<h2>Commands</h2>

<p><strong>Note:</strong><em>The word "protocol" is misspelled in the "<samp>protocal_version</samp>" key.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>

<a name="login" />
<h3><samp>login</samp> command</h3>
<p>This command ensures a session cookie has been given to the client and, if the account information is correct, adds the proper user object to the session.</p>

<ul>
<li>

<h4>Context</h4>
<p>A request with the <samp>login</samp> command may be made at any time -- there are no prerequisites.</p>

</li><li>

<h4>Form Data</h4>
<p><samp>cmd=login<br>
protocal_version=1<br>
uname=</samp><em>gallery user name</em><samp><br>
password=</samp><em>cleartext password</em><br></p>

</li><li>

<h4>Results</h4>
<p>If the login succeeds, the value
<br>
<br><samp>SUCCESS</samp>
<br>
<br>is returned.  If the login fails, the value
<br>
<br><samp>Login Incorrect</samp>
<br>
<br>is returned.  If either the <samp>uname</samp> or <samp>password</samp> keys are missing, the value
<br>
<br><samp>Missing Parameters</samp>
<br>
<br>is returned.</p>

</li></ul>

</li><li>

<a name="fetch-albums" />
<h3><samp>fetch-albums</samp> command</h3>

<p>The <samp>fetch-albums</samp> command asks the server to return a list of all albums (visible with the client's logged in user permissions).</p>

<ul>
<li>

<h4>Context</h4>
<p>A request with the <samp>login</samp> command must be made before the <samp>fetch-albums</samp> command is used.</p>

</li><li>

<h4>Form Data</h4>
<p><samp>cmd=fetch-albums<br>
protocal_version=1</samp></p>

</li><li>

<h4>Results</h4>
<p>If successful, the a request using the <samp>fetch-albums</samp> command returns tab- and newline-delimited data.  Each line consists of an album name, a tab character, the album title and a newline, except the last line which will contain the value<br>
<br><samp>SUCCESS</samp>
<br>
<br>If the "<samp>SUCCESS</samp>" value is not present, the list of albums should not be considered complete and the request to have failed.</p>

</li></ul>

</li><li>

<a name="add-item" />
    <h3><samp>add-item</samp> command</h3>
<p>This command asks the server to add a photo to a specified album.</p>

<ul>
<li>

<h4>Context</h4>
        <p>A request with the <samp>login</samp> command must be made before the 
          <samp>add-item</samp> command is used.</p>

</li><li>

<h4>Form Data</h4>
        <p><samp>cmd=add-item<br>
protocal_version=1<br>
set_albumName=</samp><em>album name</em><samp><br>
          userfile=</samp><em>form-data-encoded image data</em></p>

</li><li>

<h4>Results</h4>
<p>If the file upload succeeds the value
<br>
<br><samp>SUCCESS</samp><br>
<br>is returned.  If the file upload fails, a line beginning with the value<br>
<br><samp>ERROR:</samp><br>
<br>and followed by an English-language description of the reason is returned.</p>
